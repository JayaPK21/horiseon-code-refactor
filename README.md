# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description 

This project is created to increase the accessibility of an existing application.

Following changes have been made to the application:

* The accessibility has been increased by making the HTML and CSS files more semantic. Semantic elements helps in describing the different parts of a webpage content. The search engine and other user devices can understand the context and importance of the content.

* Added 'alt' attributes to describe all the non-text content of the webpage.

* The CSS selectors have been grouped together to make it a DRY code.

* Checked the functionality of all the links and fixed the links that were not working.

* Changed the title of the website to an appropriate one. 

* The heading tags are changed to follow a proper structure.

* Additional comments have been added in the code for other developers to know why the appropriate changes have been made.
